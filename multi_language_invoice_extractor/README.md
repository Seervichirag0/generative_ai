Using google gemini pro vision model have created a multilanguage invoice extracter app which gives any desired output 
based on the input prompt from the image uploaded of a invoice in any language. The frontend is created using streamlit.

Process- 
Firstly have to create an virtual environment and activate it and install all the dependancies required given in the requirements.txt file. 
Then import required dependancies and code for the QA Chatbot.
